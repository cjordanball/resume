# resume
Builds a resume in the style dictated by the script chosen to build it.  Current options are "visual" and "plain".  So, to see a more visually appealing resume, download the repo, go to its directory, and enter "yarn run visual"; to see a very "raw text" version (better for resumes being submitted to an automated screener), enter "yarn run plain".
